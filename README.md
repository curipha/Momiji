It is kidding itself that it is useful for 2chan users.
Because it is nothing more than a dream.

About Momiji
------------
Just a parser of Futaba-channel.

...and furthermore, it exhibits immature behavior.


### futaba.rb
Requires Nokogiri.
It can parse both catalog page and each thread.

### futaba_strscan.rb
It can be run in vanilla Ruby.
However, in return for the portability, it can parse a catalog page only.
